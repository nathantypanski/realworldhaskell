Real World Haskell
==================

This repository contains the example problems I have worked through when using 
[Real World Haskell](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596514983.do)
to study the Haskell programming language.

I try to keep it organized, but my "book work" repositories tend to become a
bit of a mess.
